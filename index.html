              <h2>Our organization's mission is to bridge the gap in technological knowledge in the Sacramento, Natomas area by empowering two generations.</h2>
                <p>We acknowledge the lack of computer science exposure in the natomas area amongst middle schoolers. Consequently, we hope to offer hands-on computer science experiences and mentorship opportunities which they may not receive at school. Additionally, we also offer seniors the resources and aid they need to develop technology literacy and stay connected with their community in this time of technological boom. Teachings in Spanish and Cantonese are available if needed.</p>

                  <h2>Youth Service</h2>
                  <p>Over the summer, we provide middle schoolers in the natomas area an opportunity to dip their feet into the computer science field. We have created a curriculum that is designed to be engaging and fun, covering topics such as the basic principles of computer science and web development with HTML and CSS. Our courses are fully free and held at the North Natomas Library. We hope to inspire students to pursure computer science through our in-depth introductory program.</p>

                  <h2>Senior Service</h2>
                  <p>Throughout the year, we provide a valuable service to seniors in the Sacramento area by offering free visits to senor apartments, homes, and retirement locations. Our personalized technological support provides assistance on how to use computers, google functions, cellphones, and other technology with confidence. Our goal is to ensure seniors to be comfortable with the skills needed to stay connected with their family and friends, access important daily information, and participate in the digital world. </p>

                    <p>With past experience in teaching and computer science, Anthony believes that computer science is a critical skill that should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their age or background. He began this program with Justin after realizing the need for more computer science education in nearby schools. He finds it rewarding to see others excel and develop their skills over time. He finds it a priveledge to be able to give back and help others in his community stay engaged and active. Aside from computer science, Anthony enjoys practicing and competing in Taekwondo and Tricking.</p>

He believes in the transformative power of education and sees teaching as an opportunity to share his enthusiasm and knowledge. Justin finds joy in witnessing students develop problem-solving skills and critical thinking through computer science education. Outside of teaching, he enjoys outdoor activities like running and hiking, spending time with family and friends, pursuing family traditions like horse-riding and staying updated with the latest technology advancements. Teaching allows Justin to make a positive impact while nurturing his own personal growth and interests.</p>
